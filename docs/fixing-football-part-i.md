# Fixing Football Part I
# The Arc of Justice
### Penalties are overly punitive punishments.


In the first matchday of the European Championship Round of 16, Germany beat Denmark somewhat handily 2-0. 

But after the game, the discourse was not about the relative merits of the respective keepers or the managers' tactical choices throughout the game, but a more timeless football question: What is a handball?

After an extremely tight offside call on the other side, German LB David Raum drove into the edge of the box and clipped in a cross that [clipped the hand of Joachim Andersen](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1drkehr/joachim_andersen_disallowed_goal_against_germany/). It was a promising position. The ball definitively touched the hand that Andersen had outstretched from his body, noticeably altering its trajectory as it sailed over the German attackers waiting in the middle. After a VAR check, Michael Oliver took about 5 seconds looking at the monitor to declare it a clear penalty. Germany went on to win the game handily 2-0.

Many Danes (and people of fine taste around the world who enjoy an upset) were upset! The hand seemed to be in a natural position for someone running and turning to block a cross. It was clearly not intentional. The ball clearly touched his hand, but did its path really change that significantly? Would it even have gotten to anyone in the middle anyway? Did this really stop a goal?

But the reality is, if that same interaction had occurred anywhere else on the field, it would've been whistled straight away and no one would think twice about it. The ball struck a hand. It was outside of the defender's body. The game is called "foot"ball. Give a free kick the other way. The reason this situation is so controversial is that it happened in the box.

The problem with handball is not the rule, it's the punishment. 

Penalties, on average, are converted in the big 5 leagues [75% of the time](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-penalty-kicks-easier-without-fans-maybe-not/). For context, on through balls, the kinds of chances that result in 1:1 opportunities, turn into goals at best around [50% of the time on average](https://www.americansocceranalysis.com/home/2021/10/8/where-goals-come-from-playing-the-killer-final-ball). A cross from the edge of the box turns into a goal at [best around 5% of the time](https://statsbomb.com/articles/soccer/how-low-can-you-go-assorted-thoughts-about-crosses/). When the referee gave Germany a penalty for a handball on the edge of the box, they upgraded a 5% chance of scoring to a 75% chance.

The average fan maybe isn't putting those numbers to it, but they know it feels unfair. It offends our sense of sensibilities, but instead of trying to fix the punishment, to make it more proportional, we focus on trying to limit adjudicating that rule.


When you look at it more closely, a whole category of VAR controversies really come down to this one fact: refs don't want to give penalties because they're unfair! But high definition replays has revealed that small fouls and handballs are happening in the box all of the time! A ref could previously safely ignore them for the sake of the integrity of the game. But now there's someone always watching, and another referee is up there being judged on how consistently they apply the laws of the game. When they call the ref over to look at the monitor, they know they are going to be judged the same way. Fans don't like it when these soft penalties get called because they want to see talented players earn goals through creativity and skill, not falling over at the right time or flipping it onto a defender's hand.


The penalty box distorts so many debates in football because it's a disproportionate punishment for the offence. Fans don't like it, refs don't like it, so they both bend over backwards to justify not giving them. But along the way, the laws of the game become more unwritten than written (of course that push was not enough of a push for a penalty, when it would have been a clear foul in the middle of the field) and everyone has a reason to feel aggrieved. So what should we do about it?


### Some Humble Proposals:
1. **Replace the Penalty Box with the Arc of Justice**: Here is a chart of expected goal value of different shots: ![xg of shots in the box](../images/Screenshot%20Unhighlighted%20xG%20by%20Position.png)
If we draw an arc around the majority of areas where a shot is converted to a goal at least 10% of the time, we have a more fair designation of where fouls deserve to be penalized with a free shot on goal, while cutting out almost half of the box from that area.
![Penalty Arc Drawn](../images/Screenshot%20Unhighlighted%20xG%20by%20Position%20With%20Arc.png)
Fouls and handballs outside of that area would instead be given as either indirect FKs or could be moved out to be a FK on the nearest spot outside the box from where the foul occurred. This is not actually a new idea! Here's a rendering from the Philadelphia Inquirer in 1912:
![Penalty Arc](https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/03/03122906/Abolish-the-PK-diagram-e1646336904493.png)
That arc is a little more restrictive than what I've drawn, but I think it honestly would be justified by the shots data! Even central shots from the top of the box don't always have a good conversion percentage.

2. **Allow Referees Discretion to Give FKs instead of Penalties for Certain "Soft Fouls"**: The arc doesn't solve all problems, what about this handball from the [World Cup Final in 2018](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx4SFXBGRDiaH4nIdFSNwyYkUBXwVvg6Qd?si=XGhEYyjhq8XAVhCN). This would likely be inside that arc area, it's a more dangerous position, but clearly the defender doesn't know anything about it, it's completely accidental. It felt very unfair that it was given as a penalty. So for these kinds of situations the ref should be given discretion to give advantageous Free Kicks to the attacking team, without going all the way to giving a penalty. Say a "close corner" from the corner of the box instead of the corner of the field? Similarly there's Manchester United ["miracle" peanlty to equalize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUSmb8rWJ3Q&ab_channel=CvetanSavov) against PSG in the Champions League. That shot is a bit of a prayer. It has very little chance of going in, the defender isn't intentionally trying to stop it with their hand, but after a VAR check, it's given as a pen and it decided the game for Man United. Now should Man United be punished by not having that called? That's what could have happened if it was outside the box. It wouldn't have been reviewed by VAR. But instead, with this new rule, they could get another chance at a comparable level of threat, say a free kick from where the original shot was struck. That's definitely more dangerous than the original shot, there's little incentive to give attackers multiple free bites at the apple. But it's proportional to the offence that had been committed. It is more consistent with a fan's view of fairness.


### Some Responses to Complications

Now I know what some people will say about especially the second idea, that it brings more uncertainty and referee's judgement into the equation. That's part of the value of the arc (all hail!) that it just reduces the area of the field where this kind of jeopardy can take place. But in general the goal is to align the rules with a sense of fairness and proportion. Instead of having an outdated narrow set of rules that apply to a wide range of situations, be more specific, and that way if there's controversy, at least the consequences of that controversy comes with more fine-grained impact. Players get more chances to earn goals.

There are a lot of other details + complaints that I've thought of (and likely many I haven't), but I'll address some of those here:
- "Doesn't less penalties favor the defense too much? Football is already low-scoring enough" - I think that likely these changes would reduce scoring in aggregate. Penalties are a fairly substantial source of goals [94 goals in last season's premier league](https://www.premierleague.com/stats/top/clubs/att_pen_goal?se=578), about how many goals Manchester City scored last season. There also could be a second order effect in that it allows defenders to be more aggressive and defend more strongly in the area. So in a high-penalty season, that could mean reducing the amount of goals by 10%! At the same time, these fouls and handballs will still be penalized. They're still becoming chances with a decent chance of conversion (more like 1 in 10 than 3 in 4). As they become more common and more important, teams will work to optimize those situations, and conversion rates would likely increase. There's also an effect I suspect which is likely harder to quantify: that referees currently call less penalties than they could because they know they're disproportionate, so these rule changes would result in more scoring opportunities, even if at less peril. Isn't that in the greater interest of the sport?

- "What's a 'Cheap Foul'? Isn't that too much of a judgement call?" - I think that this could be given clear guidelines, here are cheap fouls in my opinion that I've noticed will 1. Not get called oftentimes because it's not a focus and is deemed disproportionate. 2. Be complained about if they are called. I think they come in  two categories:
	Clear Guidelines Where Things aren't Getting Called that Should
	- Accidental Handballs
	- Fouling Player after shot (this is a clear player safety issue that right now is rarely called unless the striker is really cleared out (Jordan Pickford))
	- Foul on player who doesn't have possession and is not close to receiving the ball (i.e. holding someone on a corner when it flies over their head)

	Judgment Calls that I Would be Fine with allowing Ref Discretion to Downgrade (but would understand people not wanting)
	- Foul on player in non-dangerous area / moving away from the goal
	- Tangle of feet or other sorts of messy situations that aren't clear penalty fouls.

So depending on implementation, this could be a standard for clear guidelines to enforce certain types of fouls, or a broad system of discretion where the ref can penalize infractions in a multi-tiered manner in accordance with broader perspective of fairness.

- What does the arc do to the aesthetic purity of the field? Where the keeper is allowed to use their hands? - These are good questions, one other way of putting this is do we keep the box for the keeper and just introduce the arc for the attackers? I think honestly that this could go either way, but for the aesthetic reason, I have a slight bias towards making the arc the only new penalty area. This would also provide the dual benefit of giving more advantage to attacking players (somewhat balancing out having them receive less penalty kicks). In this day and age, goalkeepers are very adept with their feet and having a reduced area in which they can use their hands doesn't seem like it would harm them too much. On the other hand, a arc is a more irregular shape, so I could understand that being tough for keepers to intuit when they're looking up for the ball. And I'm sure any GKs would be able to provide many reasons they need the full rectangle to do their jobs safely. I don't feel too strongly about this one, it could go either way.

- Doesn't this encourage defenders to cheat? - Yellow and Red Cards should still be used to further punish dangerous or cynical play. (this is a preview of part II) I also think referees should get latitude in multiple directions! Why can't a ref just declare this a goal [Luis Suarez World Cup Handball](LINK!)? This is obviously cynical cheating, it would've gone in if not for his use of the hands, why reward that behavior?


The point of fouls is to disincentivize bad behavior. But when the punishment doesn't fit the crime, it squeezes some of the joy out of the sport. Goals from cheaply given penalties _feel cheap_ when compared to ones resulting from carefully constructed passing moves, well-weighted through-balls, or even enthusiastic pursuit of corner scraps. That's what people want to see.
